## JaiBullet

Built using a custom wrapper around the API because bullet does some weird shit that doesn't work nicely with the bindings generator _at all_. The default C wrapper for bullet is also some extreme weird shit that wraps a "physics server" around a C library and is intertwined with graphical functionality.
